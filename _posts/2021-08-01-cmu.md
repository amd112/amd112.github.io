Quick update that I'm heading to CMU! After spending 3 years at the Stanford Center on Food Security and the Environment's ECHO Lab, I'm moving to work with [Rayid Ghani](http://www.rayidghani.com/#about) at Carnegie Mellon! 

Looking forward to getting to know everyone there, explore a new city, and exciting new research challenges.
