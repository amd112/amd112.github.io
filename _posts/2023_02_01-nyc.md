I'm moving to work with the [Data Team](https://council.nyc.gov/data/) at New York City Council! The NYCC data team acts as data consultants at every step of the policy making process, assisting Council staff and Council Members in decision making.

Excited to work in the city I grew up in, and learn about the different challenges facing data in government work.
