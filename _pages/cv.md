Education
======
* B.S. in Statistical Science, Duke University, 2018

Work experience
======
* Research Data Analyst (2018-2020)
  * Stanford Center on Food Security and the Environment
  * Created R package of functions to scrape and clean data commonly used across the lab. The package reduced the frequent and multi-day task of downloading and cleaning a specific dataset to a few lines of code.
  * Assisted transition to version control and created a code review process to encourage reproducible research.
  * Co-author on 3 published papers, 2 more in review, and 2 in the pipeline.

* Data Fellow (Summer 2018)
  * University of Chicago Data Science for Social Good Program
  * Collaborated with an international team to meet needs of multiple clients and ensure work was useful to end users.
  * Simulations showed a 275% improvement in police presence near accidents.

* Johnson Distinguished Data Analyst (2016-2018)
  * The Nicholas Institute for Environmental Policy Solutions
  * Provided statistical support for research on unequal impacts of climate change and worked to identify potential research and policy questions in the local community.
  * Driven by local need for evidence of the quality of life impacts of siting new industrial hog farms, we examined revealed preference of exposure through changes in home sale prices.

* Network Analysis Consultant (Summer 2016)
  * Duke Clinical and Translational Science Institute
  * Measured collaborative research at Duke Hospital, supporting reapplication to a $47 million grant.
  * Created different metrics by which to measure collaboration, showing that for any given researcher a metric can be built that ranks them highly - pushing for a more intentional approach to data driven decision making.
  
Projects
======
* Data Science for Social Good, Mitigating Eviction Risk for Dallas Residents (2020)
  * Assisted the Dallas Child Poverty Action Lab to understand where evictions happen, and what clients are most at risk of eviction as they expanded rent assistance in response to the end of the COVID19 eviction moratorium.
* Capstone Thesis: Injustice in Environmental Toxicity Burden (2018)
  * Investigated disparities in toxicity burden for marginalized communities using terabytes of census and EPA data.
* Co-Director of Data Science, Duke Conversations (2017-2018)
