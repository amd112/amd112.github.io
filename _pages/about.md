The basics
======

I am a Research Data Analyst cross-departmentally placed at the Carnegie Mellon Machine Learning Department and Heinz College of Information Systems and Public Policy. 

I'm a past Research Analyst at the [Stanford Center on Food Security and the Environment](https://fsi.stanford.edu/people/anne-driscoll) [ECHO Lab](https://echolabs.squarespace.com/news) and past fellow at the University of Chicago [Data Science for Social Good Program](https://www.dssgfellowship.org/europe/2018-fellows-staff-europe/). I received my B.S. in Statistical Science from Duke Univeristy, where my thesis used open data to identify disproportionate toxicity burden on minority and low income communities across the US.

My reserach has broad scope, covering xyzzy with a focus on xyzzy.
