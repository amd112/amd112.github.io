My name is Anne Driscoll and I’m a Data Scientist at the New York City Council, where I work with data on people, the environment and the economy (oh my!).

In the past I’ve been a:
* Research Analyst at the [Stanford Center on Food Security and the Environment](https://fsi.stanford.edu/people/anne-driscoll)'s [Environmental Change and Human Outcomes Lab](https://echolabs.squarespace.com/news)
* fellow at the University of Chicago [Data Science for Social Good Program](https://www.dssgfellowship.org/europe/2018-fellows-staff-europe/) 
* Data Scientist at the Carnegie Mellon [Data Science and Public Policy Lab](http://www.datasciencepublicpolicy.org/), which runs the DSSG fellowship 
* Data Analyst at the Nicholas Institute for Environmental Policy Solutions.


I am interested in data science for social impact, a massively broad space - please reach out if you've got questions or just would like to chat!

## Current interests

* Blueberries - I get obsessed every summer
* Knitting! I'm currently knitting a mood blanket, similar to a the classic [temperature blanket](https://www.temperature-blanket.com/) but capturing how I feel each day.
* Sci-fi/Space Operas
* Seeing Taylor Swift an embarrasing number of times.


## Fun facts

2 truths and a lie, which is which?
* I've gone to school on 3 continents.
* Growing up I had a turtle, snail, and pigeon as pets.
* I have a credit as a production assistant on a nature documentary.
