## Hi, I'm Anne!

Hi there!

My name is Anne Driscoll and I'm a Research Data Analyst at Stanford Center on Food Security and the Environment, where I work with data on people, the environment and the economy (oh my!). 

While getting my BS at Duke, I worked on using open data to identify disproportionate toxicity burden in minority groups across the US and making those conclusions publicly accessible. 

In the past I've been a fellow at the Data Science for Social Good program and a Data Analyst at the Nicholas Institute for Environmental Policy Solutions as well as the Duke Clinical and Translational Science Institute. 

I believe that all tech is human, and thoughtfulness can ensure the way we technology aligns with our personal and political values.
